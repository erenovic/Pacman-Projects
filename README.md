# Pacman-Projects
Berkeley CS 188 Artificial Intelligence Projects with Pacman

## Project 1: Search
Implementing depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

## Project 2: Multi-Agent Search
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. In this project, multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms are implemented, as well as evaluation functions are designed.

## Project 3: Reinforcement Learning
Implementing model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook’s Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.
 
## Project 4: Bayesian Networks (BNs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs): Ghostbusters
Probabilistic inference in a Hidden Markov Model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Implementing exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.
